# Chatbot-with-TensorFlow
This is a simple AI chatbot build using Tensorflow Platform. I have created this with a specific use which is to **Navigate people in college campus**. When the user types name of a place (library,office etc.) in college it give the details of block and room no.But this can be customizable for other uses also. Project is done using python in anaconda environment and installing required modules. Inorder to customize this chatbot we have to edit the intents.json file.
